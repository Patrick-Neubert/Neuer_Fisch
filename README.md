## King_County_house_prices

This was my first project a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on House Prices in King County. Here I draft a fictive Business Case which I use for my analysis and is presented to fictive stakeholder and investors afterwards. With my analysis of the house price market of King County, I determined an indentifier for underestimated houses in the market and a location independent predictor for house realistic prices. My fictive business idea is to buy underestimated houses with lots bigger or equal to the average house size in King County and to built new houses on the lots with high potential to increase their value on the market.

## pyCHEDELICS

This was my second project (a colaboration project with Mia Reimer). Here we perform a EDA on Drug Consumption Risk based on drug consumption data of a psychologic survey. The aim of the EDA is to train a machine learning model, which predicts the probability of drug abuse for single individuals. In the end we draft a fictive app ('pyCHEDELICS Pro') with the developed model, which offers the opportunity for everyone to quickly check if they have a predisposition for drug abuse.

### Technologie

Python / Pandas / scikit-learn / NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn / Feature Engineering / Classification Model
